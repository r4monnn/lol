Start
|
|   (1) Prepare Salt Solutions
|   |
|   |   - Prepare four salt solutions: 2M NaCl, 1M NaCl, 0.5M NaCl, and 0M NaCl.
|   |   - Ensure solutions are labeled and have correct concentrations (in moles per liter, M).
|
|   (2) Prepare Brine Shrimp Dishes
|   |
|   |   - Label dishes for each salt solution concentration.
|   |   - Add brine shrimp to each dish, initially in a 0.5M NaCl solution.
|   |   - Add the corresponding salt solution to each dish.
|
|   (3) Incubation
|   |
|   |   - Allow the dishes to incubate for 30 minutes.
|
|   (4) Observation
|   |
|   |   - Use a dissection microscope to observe brine shrimp behavior and mortality.
|   |   - Record observations for each dish.
|
|   (5) Control Group Treatment
|   |
|   |   - Treat the control group dish with 0M NaCl solution.
|
|   (6) Data Collection
|   |
|   |   - Record all observations in a table, including behavior and mortality.
|
|   (7) Analysis
|   |
|   |   - Analyze the data to determine the impact of different salinity levels on brine shrimp.
|
|   (8) Conclusion
|   |
|   |   - Conclude the suitable salinity conditions for brine shrimp.
|   |   - Discuss how altering salinity levels affects behavior and survival rates.
